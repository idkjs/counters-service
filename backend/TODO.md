Hey man, I setup the next tasks that I would love you to work on them:

- [ ]  Use atd in the backend, replace all encode/decode from yojson_ppx
- [ ]  Create fixtures mechanism (have initial data loaded already)
- [ ]  Create a counter from the frontend
    - [ ]  Fetch the initial state from the server and keep it in a state
    - [ ]  When a new counter is created, update first the state and later POST it to the backend
- [ ]  Delete a counter
    - [ ]  Create delete counter endpoint
    - [ ]  Plug a button to delete one endpoint
